#### Projects

These are some main projects of mine.

- [ðŸ”© JJ.Framework](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/jjvanzon)
    - *Extensions* for the *.NET Framework*. Some of these things you might expect in the .NET Framework, but were missing there, so I programmed my own stuff. [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/jjvanzon) | [GitHub](https://github.com/jjvanzon/JJ.Framework)
- [ðŸ”µ Circular Language Spec ðŸ”¶](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Circular-Language-Spec/)
    - Have been walking around for a while with an idea for a *visual programming language* made from shapes and lines. [Web Site](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Circular-Language-Spec/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circular-Language-Spec)
